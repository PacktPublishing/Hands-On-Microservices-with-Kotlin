# Hands-On Microservices with Kotlin
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Microservices with Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/microservices-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788471459), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
With Google's inclusion of first-class support for Kotlin in their Android ecosystem, Kotlin's future as a mainstream language is assured.

Microservices help design scalable, easy-to-maintain web applications; Kotlin allows us to take advantage of modern idioms to simplify our development and create high-quality services.

With 100% interoperability with the JVM, Kotlin makes it easy to work with existing Java code.

Popular Java frameworks such as Spring, Jackson, and Reactor have included Kotlin modules to take advantage of its language featuresâ€”such as null safety and type-safe declarative builders.

This book guides the reader in designing and implementing services, achieving production- ready, testable, easy-to-maintain, lean code that's shorter and simpler than a traditional Java implementation.

You will discover the benefits of using the reactive paradigm to take advantage of non-blocking technics and take your services to the next level in terms of industry standards.

During the journey you will consume NoSQL databases reactively to allow you to create high throughput microservices.

In this book, you'll create cloud-native microservices than can run on a widely range of cloud providers, and how to monitor them.

You will create Docker containers for your Microservices and learn how to scale them.

Finally, you will deploy our microservices in OpenShift Online.
